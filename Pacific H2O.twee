(text-size:1.2)[Boiling]

This technique is a common water treatment process used throughout the world. This method of adding heat to the water causes damage to bacteria, viruses, and pathogens, effectively killing these organisms. Boiling is only effective if the water has been boiling for 20 minutes. As a result, this method has a somewhat high environmental impact score due to the energy required to heat the water.

Boiling treats for pathogens, including bacterial contaminants.

Chlorination is a common water treatment process used throughout the world. This chemical disinfection technique involves adding a chlorine-based product to water, which kills harmful viruses and bacteria. Drinking water with small amounts of chlorine does not cause harmful health effects and is a relatively cost-effective and environmentally-friendly way to protect against waterborne diseases.

Chlorination treats for pathogens, including bacterial contaminants. Chlorination also prevents bacteria from growing after the water leaves the treatment facility.

//What is a coastal aquifer?//
Water in coastal aquifers is found underground and is pumped to the surface in wells. Aquifers are delicate, thin freshwater lenses that float atop denser seawater. Rainfall replenishes the freshwater aquifers and is important for the long-term stability of this water source. 

<img src="images/coastal_aquifer.jpeg">

//Threats to coastal aquifers//
These crucial groundwater sources face multiple threats, including sea level rise, wave overtopping, over-extraction (over-use), and bacterial contamination from agriculture or waste. Climate change intensifies these threats to coastal aquifers due to increased climate variability and climate extremes.

:: Distillation {"position":"1600,125","size":"100,100"}
(text-size:1.2)[Distillation]

Distillation relies on evaporation to purify water. Contaminated water is heated to form steam, then the steam cools and is captured as purified water. This process effectively removes bacteria, viruses, parasites, salt, iron, nitrates, and sediments. Distillation is a somewhat complex and costly system and has a high environmental impact score due to the heat that is required for evaporation. 

Distillation treats for pathogens (including bacterial contaminations), desalinates, removes turbidity caused by particulates, and elimnates heavy metals and nitrates.

''Do you want to treat your sample with distillation?'' It will cost $$distillationCost and have a $distillationEP environmental impact.

(text-size:1.2)[Flocculation]

This technique is a chemical process where a coagulant (substance that causes particles to bind together) is added to water, increasing bonds between particles. This creates larger particles (called flocs) that are then easier to separate, typically with filtration afterwards. Flocculation has a somewhat low environmental impact score.

Flocculation treats for turbidity by causing contaminants to clump together so they can later be filtered out.

''Do you want to treat your sample by flocculating?'' It will cost $$flocculationCost and have a $flocculationEP environmental impact.

//What is rainwater catchment?//
Rainwater catchment is a system that catches, stores, and distributes rainwater for household use. In many local communities, residents rely on rainwater catchment systems for their freshwater needs, especially when groundwater reserves are over-extracted (over-used).

<img src="images/rainwater_catchment.png">

//Threats to rainwater catchment//
While rainwater serves as a good source of clean water, maintaining efficient catchment systems is challenging and costly. Systems need to be properly designed, maintained, and water may need to be treated before drinking. Additionally, extreme weather events such as cyclones and storm surges can cause significant damage to rainwater catchment systems. Residents can face longer dry periods and droughts, making long-term water management challenging.

Decades ago, commercial logging operations began in the inland tropical forests of the island, bringing economic gains and employment opportunities for some residents. However, the deforestation had profound ecological consequences. Deforestation caused agricultural runoff, resulting in an algal bloom in the lagoon. This led to widespread mortality of marine organisms. Additionally, the high levels of soil erosion severely impacted downstream water quality, compromising access to clean drinking water.

* [[pH test]], $1: A quick test strip which indicates a liquidâ€™s pH value. This assay requires a few minutes to complete and is a cheap test.
* [[Salinity assay]], $3: Salinity is the measure of salt in a liquid. A saline concentration test strip determines the salt content of the water sample. This test requires a few minutes to complete and is relatively inexpensive.
* [[Turbidity test]], $1: Turbidity is the measure of a liquidâ€™s clarity. Highly turbid liquid has an opaque, cloudy appearance, while low-turbid liquid is clear and transparent. Turbidity is caused by materials such as sand, clay, algae, oils, dirt, or bacteria. The water sample visually assessed to determine its turbidity, or cloudiness. This test takes a few minutes to complete and is an inexpensive test.

You've used your extra funds to support <a href="https://www.nature.org/en-us/about-us/where-we-work/asia-pacific/asia-and-the-pacific-women-in-conservation/women-guardians-of-the-mangroves/" target="_blank">Mangrove Market Meri</a>: an organisation created by women to manage mangroves sustainably. Mangroves trap sediment from land runoff, buffer coastal communities against storm surges, and are breeding and feeding grounds for fish and shellfish.

{(set: $newpHResult to 0)(set: $newpHVal to -1000)}
The optimal pH for drinking water is in the range of 6.5-8.5. Water with a pH above or below this range is not considered safe. To change the pH, tablets can be added to the water which causes a chemical reaction. This reaction results in an optimal pH for water. However, pH can be very sensitive, and attempts to raise or lower pH could easily overshoot the optimal drinking water range.

After you've used a pH tablet, you may perform a free pH test to determine the effect of the pH tablet.

Ask your teacher for a small strip of pH paper. It is recommended to dip the paper into your water sample then instantly compare the resulting colour to the colour chart provided. Make a note of the result in your lab notebook.

:: was properly treated {"position":"1800,1500","size":"100,100"}
Great job on properly treating the water! Everyone in the community is glad to have safe drinking water. 

You used most of your budget, so there's not enough leftover to allocate to other community initiatives. 

{(if: $enviroPoints <-15)[However your treatments had a significant impact on the environment, and will likely contribute to degradation of the local ecosystem.]}

[[The End]]


:: wasn't treated properly {"position":"1525,1250","size":"100,100"}
Your didn't remove all of the contaminants from your water supply. A lot of people got sick and ended up in hospital. This caused many people to miss work, and hospital staff were overwhelmed.

:: your job {"position":"600,350","size":"100,100"}
Your team's job is to treat the water so that it can be used by community members. Remember, $Player1, your priority is to ensure the water is as clean as possible by performing all necessary tests and treatments. $Player2, you must monitor your team's environmental impact and try to keep your Environmental Points as close to zero as possible. Finally, $Player3, don't forget about the budget! Your team has been trusted with funds to complete this project, and leftover money can be allocated to other uses in the community.
